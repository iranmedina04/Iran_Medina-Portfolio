# IC Verification

This folder showcases my IC verification projects, all of which were collaborative efforts. The initial project focuses on verifying a data bus using the layered verification model in SystemVerilog. The second project involves the verification of a router using the same model, and finally, the verification of this system using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology). Throughout all projects, the primary emphasis was on verifying the functionality of the systems and assessing their latency.
