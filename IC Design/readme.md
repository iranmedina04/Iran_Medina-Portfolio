# Digital Design


In this folder, the progress of VLSI digital design projects undertaken collaboratively throughout the academic program is showcased. The documentation reflects the acquisition of skills in combinational and sequential logic, demonstrating how these fundamentals have been applied and advanced in the development of more intricate systems conforming to UART and SPI protocols. Additionally, the practical application of these protocols for real-world scenarios is explored. The folder also encompasses the creation of both single-cycle and pipeline processors, drawing inspiration from relevant literature in the field.
